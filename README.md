Java Katas for everyday coding warmumps

The idea behind those little Katas (exercises) is to give our brains a little stretch and warmup in the morning before 
we get down to any serious work. It might or might not replace your morning cup of coffee. 
Treat your brain as a muscle - which require a bit of warmup before doing any heavy lifting.

Feel free to work on solutions and create pull requests to discuss them together.
Also feel free to suggest katas of your own to build up this repository into a set of cool challanges for others to exercise with.

Enjoy!
